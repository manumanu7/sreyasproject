		Although the Agra Fort was built under the watchful eyes of King Akbar, its final architecture and design is the result of construction by many different empires. Made of red sandstone and marble, the fort possesses an appealing aura and pleasant charm.

The only point of entry for tourists to the magnificent Agra Fort is the Amar Singh Gate. Once inside, you can visit the palaces and the courtyard. One of the famous spots inside the Agra Fort is the Jahangiri Mahal that has a deep pool with stone steps.
