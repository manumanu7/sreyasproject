		Kailasa Temple, Ellora Caves
		<p>
		<big><big>
		Dedicated to Lord Shiva, the temple took 150 years and 7,000 labourers to craft the Kailasa temple out of one single rock. It is the world’s oldest single rock carving. Built at a time where technology and mechanism were not as advance as today, the Kailasa temple is an architectural marvel. People still haven’t been able to completely understand how this ancient monolithic structure was created so many centuries back!
