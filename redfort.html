		Ask anyone in Delhi about a must-visit place and they will tell you to drop by at the Red Fort. Built by Shah Jahan, this fort is a testament to the glorious architectural pride of the Mughal Empire. Visit the fort and soak in the tremendous historic ambience.

Thereâ€™s a lot to see at the fort and for the best experience hire a guide. If you are visiting in the evening, do not forget to sit down for the sound and light show that is narrated by the legendary Bollywood actor Amitabh Bachchan.
