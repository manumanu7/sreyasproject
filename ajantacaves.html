		<p>
		<big><big>
		The Ajanta Caves were believed to have been cut out of the rock by Buddhist monks. These historic caves are fine examples of ancient Indian art and expressive painting. The caves are also UNESCO World Heritage Sites.

There are 30 caves at the site, but not all are accessible to tourists. If you are visiting during the peak tourist season, entry to the caves are only allowed for 15 minutes per person, to avoid crowding.
